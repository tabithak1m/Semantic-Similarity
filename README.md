# Semantic-Similarity

In this project, an intelligent system that can solve "synonym questions" commonly found in English language exams such as TOEFEL (Test of English as a Foreign Language). Here, this program will be able to find the best match for the synonym of a suggested word by measuring the semantic similarity of pairs of words. Here, this is measured by finding the cosine similarity of semantic descriptor vectors where these vectors consists of words and the number of their appearance in each sentence.  
The test for the code uses the text.txt file provided by Professor Michael Guerzoy and the program successfully finds the correct synonym for the word "feline" given the choices:  
(a) dog
(b) cat
(c) horse
